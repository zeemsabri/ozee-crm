# Upload Project Documents Permission Fix

## Issue Description

Users with the "Upload Project Documents" permission through a project role were still getting a message "You don't have permission to upload documents" on the frontend, specifically in the Documents section of the ProjectForm component.

The API response for project permissions correctly included the "upload_project_documents" permission:

```json
{
    "project_id": 2,
    "global_role": {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Contractor",
        "slug": "contractor",
        "type": "application"
    },
    "project_role": {
        "id": 8,
        "name": "Project Manager",
        "slug": "project-manager",
        "type": "project"
    },
    "permissions": [
        {
            "id": 12,
            "name": "View Projects",
            "slug": "view_projects",
            "category": "Project Management",
            "source": "project"
        },
        {
            "id": 18,
            "name": "Manage Projects",
            "slug": "manage_projects",
            "category": "Project Management",
            "source": "project"
        },
        {
            "id": 20,
            "name": "Upload Project Documents",
            "slug": "upload_project_documents",
            "category": "Project Management",
            "source": "project"
        }
    ]
}
```

*Note: The actual API response includes more permissions, but they are omitted here for brevity.*

However, the permission check in the frontend was failing, causing the upload section to be hidden.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `canDo` function in the permissions.js utility. This function is used to check if a user has a specific permission, and it's used in the ProjectForm component to determine whether to show the document upload section:

```javascript
// In ProjectForm.vue
const canUploadProjectDocuments = canDo('upload_project_documents', userProjectRole);

// In the template
<div v-if="canUploadProjectDocuments.value" class="mb-4">
    <!-- Document upload section -->
</div>
```

The `canDo` function was checking for permissions in the project role object:

```javascript
const canDo = (permissionSlug, projectRole = null) => {
  return computed(() => {
    // If we have a project role, check it first regardless of whether we have a project ID
    if (projectRole && projectRole.value) {
      // Check if permissions are directly in the role object
      if (projectRole.value.permissions) {
        const projectPermission = projectRole.value.permissions.find(p => p.slug === permissionSlug);
        if (projectPermission) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    }

    // If no permission found in project role or no project role provided, use the store's hasPermission getter
    return permissionStore.hasPermission(permissionSlug, validProjectId);
  });
};
```

However, the API response structure places the permissions in the top-level `permissions` array, not in the `project_role` object. The `project_role` object doesn't have a `permissions` array, so the check `projectRole.value.permissions` was always falsy, causing the function to fall back to the store's `hasPermission` getter.

The `hasPermission` getter in the store was correctly checking the top-level permissions array, but only if the project ID was provided directly. When the `canDo` function was called with a project role but no project ID, it wasn't checking the project permissions correctly.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the `canDo` function to check both the project role and the project permissions:

```javascript
const canDo = (permissionSlug, projectRole = null) => {
  return computed(() => {
    // If we have a project role, check it first regardless of whether we have a project ID
    if (projectRole && projectRole.value) {
      // Check if permissions are directly in the role object
      if (projectRole.value.permissions) {
        const projectPermission = projectRole.value.permissions.find(p => p.slug === permissionSlug);
        if (projectPermission) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    }

    // If we have a valid project ID, check the project permissions directly
    if (validProjectId) {
      const projectPermissions = permissionStore.projectPermissions[validProjectId];
      if (projectPermissions && projectPermissions.permissions) {
        const hasPermission = projectPermissions.permissions.some(p => p.slug === permissionSlug);
        if (hasPermission) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    }

    // If no permission found in project role or project permissions, use the store's hasPermission getter
    // This will check global permissions
    return permissionStore.hasPermission(permissionSlug, validProjectId);
  });
};
```

The key change is the addition of a new check that looks for permissions directly in the project permissions data:

```javascript
// If we have a valid project ID, check the project permissions directly
if (validProjectId) {
  const projectPermissions = permissionStore.projectPermissions[validProjectId];
  if (projectPermissions && projectPermissions.permissions) {
    const hasPermission = projectPermissions.permissions.some(p => p.slug === permissionSlug);
    if (hasPermission) {
      return true;
    }
  }
}
```

This check is performed after checking the project role but before falling back to the global permissions check. It looks for the permission in the top-level permissions array of the project permissions data, which is where the "upload_project_documents" permission is stored according to the API response.

## Testing

A test script was created to verify that the fix works correctly. The script:

1. Mocks the permission store with project permissions data that matches the API response.
2. Mocks the project role object without a permissions array, which is the issue we're fixing.
3. Implements both the original and fixed versions of the `canDo` function.
4. Tests both implementations with the "upload_project_documents" permission and a non-existent permission.

The test results show that:
- The original implementation fails to identify the "upload_project_documents" permission (returns false).
- The fixed implementation correctly identifies the "upload_project_documents" permission (returns true).
- Both implementations correctly handle non-existent permissions (return false).

## Impact

This fix ensures that users with the "Upload Project Documents" permission through their project role can see and use the document upload section in the ProjectForm component. It doesn't affect any other permission checks or functionality.

The fix is backward compatible with existing code, as it maintains the same API for the `canDo` function and doesn't change how permissions are stored or retrieved from the API.

## Files Changed

## Future Improvements

1. Consider updating the API response structure to include permissions in the project role object, which would make the permission checking logic simpler and more intuitive.

2. Add more comprehensive error handling and logging to help diagnose permission-related issues in the future.

3. Add unit tests for the permission checking logic to ensure it works correctly with different API response structures and edge cases.

4. Consider caching permission checks to improve performance, especially for frequently checked permissions.
