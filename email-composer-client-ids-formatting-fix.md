# Email Composer Client IDs Formatting Fix

## Overview

This document describes the fix for an issue with the client_ids formatting in the Email Composer form submission. The issue was causing validation errors when submitting the form.

## Issue Description

When submitting the Email Composer form, the following payload was being sent:

```json
{
    "project_id": 2,
    "client_ids": [
        {
            "id": {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Test Client"
            }
        }
    ],
    "subject": "test",
    "body": "test",
    "status": "pending_approval"
}
```

This resulted in the following validation error:

```json
{
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "errors": {
        "client_ids.0.id": [
            "The selected client_ids.0.id is invalid."
        ]
    }
}
```

The issue was that the client_ids array contained objects with an 'id' property that was itself an object (with 'id' and 'name' properties), instead of a simple ID value. This nested structure was causing the validation to fail.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `submitEmailForApproval` function in `resources/js/Pages/Emails/Composer.vue`. The function was formatting the client_ids array as follows:

```javascript
// Format client_ids as array of objects with id property
const formattedClientIds = emailForm.client_ids.map(clientId => {
    return { id: clientId };
});
```

The problem was that `emailForm.client_ids` could contain either simple ID values (numbers or strings) or client objects (with 'id' and 'name' properties). When it contained client objects, the code above would create a nested structure where 'id' was an object instead of a simple value.

## Solution

The solution was to check if each item in `emailForm.client_ids` is already an object, and if so, extract just the ID property:

```javascript
// Format client_ids as array of objects with id property
const formattedClientIds = emailForm.client_ids.map(clientId => {
    // Check if clientId is already an object with an id property
    if (typeof clientId === 'object' && clientId !== null) {
        return { id: clientId.id };
    }
    // Otherwise, assume it's a simple ID value
    return { id: clientId };
});
```

This change handles both cases:
1. If `emailForm.client_ids` contains simple ID values (numbers or strings), it wraps them in an object with an 'id' property.
2. If `emailForm.client_ids` contains client objects (with 'id' and 'name' properties), it extracts just the 'id' property and wraps it in a new object.

## Testing

A test script (`test-email-client-ids-formatting.js`) was created to verify that the fix works correctly in various scenarios:

1. Test 1: Tests formatting with simple ID values (numbers)
2. Test 2: Tests formatting with client objects (with id and name properties)
3. Test 3: Tests formatting with a mix of simple IDs and client objects
4. Test 4: Tests with the actual Composer component by mocking axios.post and capturing the payload

To run the test script:

1. Navigate to the Email Composer page in the browser
2. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `test-email-client-ids-formatting.js` into the console
4. Press Enter to run the tests

Expected results:
- All tests should pass, indicating that the client_ids are formatted correctly in all scenarios
- The payload captured in Test 4 should show client_ids as an array of objects, each with an 'id' property that is a simple value (not an object)

## Impact

This fix ensures that the Email Composer form submission works correctly, preventing validation errors when submitting the form. It handles both cases where `emailForm.client_ids` contains simple ID values or client objects.
