# Role ID Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to transition from using the `role` string column to using the `role_id` foreign key in the application.

## Database Changes
1. Removed the `role` column from the `project_user` table
2. Ensured the `role_id` column exists in the `project_user` table
3. Removed the `role` column from the `users` table
4. Ensured the `role_id` column exists in the `users` table

## Model Changes

### User Model
1. Removed `role` from the `$fillable` array
2. Removed `role` from the `$casts` array
3. Updated the `projects()` method to use only `role_id` in `withPivot`
4. Fixed the role helper methods (`isSuperAdmin()`, `isManager()`, etc.) to work with `role_id`
5. Added a `getRoleAttribute()` accessor for backward compatibility
6. Updated the `getRoleForProject()` method to return `role_id` instead of `role`

### Project Model
No significant changes were needed in the Project model as it was already using the relationship correctly.

## Controller Changes

### UserController
1. Updated validation rules to use hyphenated slugs (e.g., `super-admin` instead of `super_admin`)
2. Updated the `store` method to use `role_id` instead of `role`
3. Updated the `update` method to use `role_id` instead of `role`
4. Removed code that was updating the legacy `user_role` relationship

### ProjectController
1. Updated all instances of `withPivot('role')` to `withPivot('role_id')`
2. Updated all instances of `'role' => $user['role']` to `'role_id' => $user['role_id']`

## Frontend Changes

### ProjectForm.vue
1. Updated client mapping to use `role_id` instead of `role`
2. Updated user mapping to use `role_id` instead of `role`
3. Updated client addition code to use `role_id` instead of `role`
4. Updated user addition code to use `role_id` instead of `role`
5. Updated client and user role selection to use `role_id` instead of `role`
6. Updated filter for `client_ids` and `user_ids` to check for `role_id` instead of `role`

### AuthenticatedLayout.vue
1. Updated to use `role_data.slug` for role checks instead of the `role` string
2. Updated the user name and role display to use `role_data.name`

## Testing
1. Created test scripts to verify the changes:
   - `test-role-changes.php`: Tests the database schema and model changes
   - `test-user-controller.php`: Tests the UserController changes
   - `test-frontend-changes.php`: Tests the frontend compatibility

## Backward Compatibility
To maintain backward compatibility:
1. Added a `getRoleAttribute()` accessor to the User model that returns the role slug
2. Kept the legacy `roles()` relationship in the User model
3. Kept the legacy role helper methods (`hasRole()`, `assignRole()`, etc.)

## Future Improvements
1. Remove the backward compatibility code once all parts of the application have been updated to use `role_id`
2. Update the frontend to use the new role system exclusively
3. Remove the legacy `user_role` table and related code
