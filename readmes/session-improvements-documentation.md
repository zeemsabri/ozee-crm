# User Session Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to improve user sessions in the application. The issue was that users appeared to be logged in, but when they refreshed the page, they were redirected to the login page. Additionally, the "Remember me" functionality on the login page needed to be properly implemented.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Session Lifetime

The session lifetime was increased from 120 minutes (2 hours) to 1440 minutes (24 hours) in the session configuration:

```php
// config/session.php
'lifetime' => (int) env('SESSION_LIFETIME', 1440),
```

This change ensures that users' sessions last longer before expiring, reducing the frequency of unexpected logouts.

### 2. Enabled Stateful API Requests

The `EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful` middleware was enabled in the HTTP Kernel to ensure that API requests maintain the session state:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php
'api' => [
    \Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class.':api',
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
],
```

This middleware is crucial for making Laravel Sanctum work with frontend applications, as it enables session cookies to be used with API routes.

### 3. Improved "Remember Me" Functionality

The Login.vue file was modified to better handle the "Remember me" functionality:

```javascript
// resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.vue
// Store whether this is a remembered session
localStorage.setItem('remembered', form.remember ? 'true' : 'false');
```

This change ensures that the frontend is properly tracking whether the user checked the "Remember me" box during login.

### 4. Enhanced Session Validation

The AuthenticatedLayout.vue file was modified to better handle authentication and session management:

```javascript
// resources/js/Layouts/AuthenticatedLayout.vue
const setAxiosAuthHeader = async () => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    if (token) {
        window.axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
        
        // Verify that the token is still valid by making a request to the user endpoint
        try {
            await window.axios.get('/api/user');
        } catch (error) {
            // If we get a 401 Unauthorized error, the token is no longer valid
            // This could happen if the session expired on the server
            if (error.response && error.response.status === 401) {
                console.log('Session expired, redirecting to login');
                // Clear localStorage and redirect to login
                localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
                localStorage.removeItem('userRole');
                localStorage.removeItem('userId');
                localStorage.removeItem('userEmail');
                localStorage.removeItem('remembered');
                delete window.axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'];
                window.location.href = '/login';
            }
        }
    } else {
        delete window.axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'];
    }
};
```

This change ensures that the frontend properly handles the case where the session has expired but the token is still in localStorage. When the user refreshes the page, the AuthenticatedLayout component will check if the token is still valid, and if not, it will redirect to the login page.

## How These Changes Fix the Issue

The combination of these changes addresses the issue in several ways:

1. **Longer Session Lifetime**: By increasing the session lifetime to 24 hours, users are less likely to experience unexpected logouts due to session expiration.

2. **Stateful API Requests**: By enabling the `EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful` middleware, API requests will maintain the session state, ensuring that the backend recognizes the user's session even after page refreshes.

3. **Improved "Remember Me" Functionality**: By properly tracking whether the user checked the "Remember me" box, the application can provide a better user experience for users who want to stay logged in for longer periods.

4. **Enhanced Session Validation**: By validating the token on page load, the application can detect when a session has expired and handle it gracefully, redirecting the user to the login page instead of showing a partially authenticated state.

## Testing

To verify that these changes have fixed the issue, you should:

1. Log in to the application with the "Remember me" checkbox unchecked
2. Refresh the page and verify that you remain logged in
3. Wait for more than 24 hours (the new session lifetime)
4. Refresh the page and verify that you are redirected to the login page
5. Log in again with the "Remember me" checkbox checked
6. Refresh the page and verify that you remain logged in
7. Close the browser and reopen it
8. Navigate to the application and verify that you are still logged in (if "Remember me" was checked)

## Conclusion

These changes should significantly improve the user session experience in the application. Users should now remain logged in for longer periods, and the "Remember me" functionality should work as expected. If users are still experiencing issues with being logged out unexpectedly, further investigation may be needed.
