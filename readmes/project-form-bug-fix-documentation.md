# ProjectForm Bug Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

When loading the ProjectForm component, the following error was occurring:

```
Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: Cannot access 'props' before initialization
    at setup (ProjectForm.vue:17:21)
```

This error was happening because the code was trying to access the `props` variable before it was initialized. In Vue 3's Composition API, props need to be defined before they can be used in the setup function.

## Root Cause

In the ProjectForm.vue file, line 17 was attempting to access `props.project` before the `props` variable was defined:

```javascript
// Line 17
const project = ref(props.project || {});

// ...

// Line 85 (props defined much later)
const props = defineProps({
    show: { type: Boolean, required: true },
    project: { type: Object, default: () => ({}) },
    // ...other props
});
```

In Vue 3's Composition API, the `defineProps` function needs to be called before any references to `props` in the setup function.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Initialized the `project` ref with an empty object instead of using `props.project`:
   ```javascript
   const project = ref({});
   ```

2. Moved the `defineProps` call before any references to `props`:
   ```javascript
   const props = defineProps({
       show: { type: Boolean, required: true },
       project: { type: Object, default: () => ({}) },
       // ...other props
   });
   ```

3. Kept the watch function that updates the project ref when props.project changes:
   ```javascript
   watch(() => props.project, (newProject) => {
       project.value = newProject || {};
   }, { immediate: true });
   ```

## Verification

A test script was created to simulate the component setup process and verify that the fix works correctly. The test script ran successfully without any errors, confirming that the "Cannot access 'props' before initialization" issue has been resolved.

## Best Practices for Vue 3 Composition API

To avoid similar issues in the future, follow these best practices:

1. Always define props using `defineProps` at the beginning of the setup function, before any references to `props`.
2. If you need to initialize a reactive reference with a prop value, use a two-step approach:
   - Initialize the ref with a default value
   - Use a watch function with `immediate: true` to update the ref when the prop changes
3. Be mindful of the order of operations in the setup function, especially when dealing with props and reactive references.

By following these practices, you can avoid the "Cannot access 'props' before initialization" error and ensure that your Vue 3 components work correctly.
