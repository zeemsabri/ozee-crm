# Availability Calendar User Display Fix

## Issues Description

Two issues were addressed in this fix:

1. **Availabilities Not Displaying in Calendar View**: Availabilities were being saved successfully to the database, but they were not being displayed in the Calendar view. The API was returning the correct data, but the availabilities were not appearing in the calendar.

2. **User Names Not Displayed with Availabilities**: The calendar view only showed "Available" or "Not Available" without indicating which user the availability belonged to, making it difficult to identify whose availability was being displayed.

## Root Causes

### Availabilities Not Displaying in Calendar View

The issue was caused by a date format mismatch in the `availabilitiesByDate` computed property of the AvailabilityCalendar component:

1. The API returns dates in ISO format with time component: `"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z"`
2. The component's `weekDays` computed property generates dates in simple format: `"2025-07-25"`
3. The `availabilitiesByDate` computed property was directly comparing these two different formats: `a.date === day.date`
4. This comparison always failed because `"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z" !== "2025-07-25"`

### User Names Not Displayed with Availabilities

The issue was that the API response did not include user information with each availability, and the component template was not designed to display user names. The template only showed "Available" or "Not Available" without any user identification.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix for Availabilities Not Displaying

1. Modified the `availabilitiesByDate` computed property to extract the date part from ISO date strings before comparison:

```javascript
grouped[day.date] = availabilities.value.filter(a => {
    // Extract date part from ISO date string (handles both "2025-07-25" and "2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z" formats)
    const availabilityDate = a.date.split('T')[0];
    return availabilityDate === day.date;
});
```

This change ensures that dates are compared in the same format, regardless of whether the API returns simple date strings or ISO date strings with time.

### Fix for User Names Not Displayed

1. Modified the AvailabilityController to include user information in the API response by eager loading the user relationship:

```php
// Base query
$query = UserAvailability::with('user:id,name')->whereBetween('date', [$startDate, $endDate]);
```

2. Updated the AvailabilityCalendar component template to display user names with each availability:

```vue
<span class="font-medium" :class="availability.is_available ? 'text-green-700' : 'text-red-700'">
    {{ availability.user ? availability.user.name + ' - ' : '' }}{{ availability.is_available ? 'Available' : 'Not Available' }}
</span>
```

This change displays the user's name followed by a dash and then the availability status (e.g., "John Doe - Available").

## Files Changed

1. `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AvailabilityController.php`
   - Modified the `index` method to eager load the user relationship with each availability

2. `/resources/js/Components/Availability/AvailabilityCalendar.vue`
   - Updated the `availabilitiesByDate` computed property to handle ISO date strings
   - Modified the template to display user names with each availability

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Navigate to the Weekly Availability page (/availability)
2. Verify that availabilities are displayed correctly in the calendar view
3. Verify that each availability shows the user's name along with the availability status
4. Create a new availability record by clicking the "Add" button for a specific day
5. Fill in the availability information and save
6. Verify that the new availability appears in the calendar with the user's name
7. Refresh the page
8. Verify that all availabilities still appear correctly after refresh

## Additional Notes

These fixes address common issues with date format handling and data relationships in web applications:

1. When working with dates from APIs, it's important to ensure consistent formatting or to normalize the formats before comparison.
2. When displaying data that belongs to users, it's often helpful to include user information in the API response through eager loading relationships.
3. Always include conditional checks in templates when accessing nested properties to handle cases where data might be missing.

The solution is robust because it:
1. Handles both simple date strings and ISO date strings with time
2. Includes user information in the API response for better context
3. Gracefully handles cases where user information might be missing
4. Improves the user experience by clearly showing whose availability is being displayed
