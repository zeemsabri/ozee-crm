# Email 'to' Field Conversion Fix

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a fix to convert the JSON-encoded array of email addresses in the `$email->to` field to a comma-separated string before passing it to the `sendEmail` method of the `GmailService`.

## Issue Description

The issue was that the `$email->to` field contained a JSON-encoded array of email addresses, like:

```
"[\"info@mmsitandwebsolutions.com.au\",\"zeemsabri@gmail.com\"]"
```

But the `sendEmail` method of the `GmailService` expects a comma-separated string of email addresses, like:

```
"info@mmsitandwebsolutions.com.au,zeemsabri@gmail.com"
```

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. Added a conversion step in the `approve` method of the `EmailController` to decode the JSON array and convert it to a comma-separated string:

```php
// Get client's email from the linked conversation/client
$recipientClientEmail = $email->to;

// Convert JSON-encoded array to comma-separated string
if (is_string($recipientClientEmail) && $this->isJson($recipientClientEmail)) {
    $emailArray = json_decode($recipientClientEmail, true);
    $recipientClientEmail = implode(',', $emailArray);
}

// Send email using GmailService
$gmailMessageId = $this->gmailService->sendEmail(
    $recipientClientEmail,
    $email->subject,
    $email->body
);
```

2. Added a private helper method `isJson` to the `EmailController` class to check if a string is valid JSON:

```php
/**
 * Check if a string is a valid JSON
 *
 * @param string $string
 * @return bool
 */
private function isJson($string) {
    json_decode($string);
    return (json_last_error() == JSON_ERROR_NONE);
}
```

### How It Works

1. When the `approve` method is called, it gets the `$email->to` field, which contains a JSON-encoded array of email addresses.
2. It checks if the value is a string and if it's valid JSON using the `isJson` helper method.
3. If it is, it decodes the JSON array and converts it to a comma-separated string using `implode(',', $emailArray)`.
4. The resulting comma-separated string is then passed to the `sendEmail` method of the `GmailService`.

This ensures that the email addresses are in the correct format for the `sendEmail` method, which expects a comma-separated string.

## Testing

A test script (`test-email-to-conversion.php`) was created to verify that the conversion logic works correctly. The script tests three scenarios:

1. JSON-encoded array of email addresses (converts to comma-separated string)
2. Single email address (leaves it unchanged)
3. Empty JSON array (converts to empty string)

All tests passed, confirming that the conversion logic works correctly.

## Impact

This fix ensures that emails with multiple recipients are sent correctly, as the `sendEmail` method now receives the email addresses in the expected format.
