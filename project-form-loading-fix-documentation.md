# ProjectForm Loading Variable Fix

## Issue Description

An error was occurring in the ProjectForm component:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: loading is not defined
    at Proxy.switchTab (ProjectForm.vue:98:9)
    at _createElementBlock.onClick._cache.<computed>._cache.<computed>
```

The error occurred because the `switchTab` function was trying to use a `loading` variable that wasn't defined in the component.

## Solution

Added a missing `loading` ref variable to the component:

```javascript
const loading = ref(false); // Loading state for data fetching
```

This variable is used in the `switchTab` function to indicate when data is being fetched for a tab:

```javascript
// Show loading indicator
loading.value = true;

// Fetch data based on the selected tab
switch (tabName) {
    case 'basic':
        fetchBasicData(projectForm.id).finally(() => {
            loading.value = false;
        });
        break;
    // ... other cases
}
```

## Implementation Details

The fix was implemented by adding the missing variable definition near other similar state variables in the component (around line 442).

## Benefits

1. Fixed the reference error that was preventing the tab switching functionality from working properly
2. Properly manages loading state during data fetching operations
3. Maintains consistent code structure with other state variables in the component

## File Changed

- `/resources/js/Components/ProjectForm.vue`
