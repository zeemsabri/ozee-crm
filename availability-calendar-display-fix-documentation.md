# Availability Calendar Display Fix

## Issue Description

Availabilities were being saved successfully to the database, but they were not being displayed in the Calendar view. The API was returning the correct data, as shown in this example response:

```json
{
    "availabilities": [
        {
            "id": 3,
            "user_id": 1,
            "date": "2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z",
            "is_available": true,
            "reason": null,
            "time_slots": [
                {
                    "end_time": "12:57",
                    "start_time": "11:56"
                }
            ],
            "created_at": "2025-07-24T03:56:36.000000Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-07-24T03:56:36.000000Z"
        }
    ],
    "start_date": "2025-07-20",
    "end_date": "2025-07-26"
}
```

However, the availabilities were not appearing in the calendar, even though the data was being returned from the API.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a date format mismatch in the `availabilitiesByDate` computed property of the AvailabilityCalendar component:

1. The API returns dates in ISO format with time component: `"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z"`
2. The component's `weekDays` computed property generates dates in simple format: `"2025-07-25"`
3. The `availabilitiesByDate` computed property was directly comparing these two different formats: `a.date === day.date`
4. This comparison always failed because `"2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z" !== "2025-07-25"`

## Solution

The solution was to modify the `availabilitiesByDate` computed property to extract just the date part from the ISO date string before comparing:

```javascript
// Group availabilities by date
const availabilitiesByDate = computed(() => {
    const grouped = {};

    weekDays.value.forEach(day => {
        grouped[day.date] = availabilities.value.filter(a => {
            // Extract date part from ISO date string (handles both "2025-07-25" and "2025-07-25T00:00:00.000000Z" formats)
            const availabilityDate = a.date.split('T')[0];
            return availabilityDate === day.date;
        });
    });

    return grouped;
});
```

This change:
1. Extracts the date part from the ISO date string using `a.date.split('T')[0]`
2. Handles both formats: simple date strings and ISO date strings with time
3. Compares the extracted date part with `day.date`, which is already in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"

## Files Changed

1. `/resources/js/Components/Availability/AvailabilityCalendar.vue`
   - Modified the `availabilitiesByDate` computed property to handle ISO date strings

## Testing

A test script has been created to verify the fix: `test-calendar-display-fix.js`

To test the fix:

1. Navigate to the Weekly Availability page (/availability)
2. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Copy and paste the content of `test-calendar-display-fix.js` into the console
4. Check the console output for the test results

Expected behavior:
- The script should show that availabilities from the API are properly displayed in the calendar
- You should see "Success! All availabilities are properly displayed in the calendar" in the console
- You should also see "Success! Availabilities are rendered in the DOM" in the console

## Manual Testing

You can also test the fix manually:

1. Navigate to the Weekly Availability page (/availability)
2. Create a new availability record by clicking the "Add" button for a specific day
3. Fill in the availability information and save
4. Verify that the availability appears in the calendar
5. Refresh the page
6. Verify that the availability still appears in the calendar after refresh

## Additional Notes

This fix addresses a common issue with date format handling in JavaScript applications. When working with dates from APIs, it's important to ensure consistent formatting or to normalize the formats before comparison. In this case, we chose to normalize the API date format to match the format used in the component.

The solution is robust because it:
1. Handles both simple date strings and ISO date strings with time
2. Doesn't require changes to the API or database
3. Is implemented in a single location where the comparison happens
