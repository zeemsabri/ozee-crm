# Tab Refs Fix Summary

## Issue
In `resources/js/Pages/Emails/Inbox/Index.vue` at line 277, there was an error:
```
Index.vue:277 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'new')
```

This occurred because the code was trying to set a property on `tabRefs.value` when it might be undefined.

## Fix
Added a safety check to ensure both the element and `tabRefs.value` exist before attempting to set a property:

```javascript
// Before:
:ref="el => tabRefs.value[tab.id] = el"

// After:
:ref="el => { if (el && tabRefs.value) tabRefs.value[tab.id] = el }"
```

This prevents the "Cannot set properties of undefined" error by ensuring we only attempt to set the property when the parent object exists.

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and should prevent the error from occurring. The change is minimal and focused on the specific issue without affecting other functionality.
