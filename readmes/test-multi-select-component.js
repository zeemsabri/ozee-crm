Manual Testing Instructions:
1. Log in to the application with different user roles:
   - Super Admin (should see Remove buttons for both clients and users)
   - User with manage_project_clients permission (should see Remove buttons for clients only)
   - User with manage_project_users permission (should see Remove buttons for users only)
   - User without either permission (should not see any Remove buttons)

2. Navigate to a project form and go to the Clients and Users tab.

3. Check if the Remove buttons are visible or hidden based on your permissions:
   - For clients: Remove button should only be visible if you have manage_project_clients permission
   - For users: Remove button should only be visible if you have manage_project_users permission

4. Try adding and removing clients and users to verify that the functionality works correctly
   when the Remove buttons are visible.
