# Project Tier ID Fix Summary

## Issue
When saving the ProjectEditBasicInfo.vue form, the `project_tier_id` was not being included in the payload sent to the server.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified FormData Construction
- Added explicit handling for `project_tier_id` in the FormData construction
- Added type conversion to ensure consistent type handling
- Added detailed logging to track the value and type of `project_tier_id`

```javascript
// Explicitly add project_tier_id to ensure it's included
if (localProjectForm.project_tier_id !== null && localProjectForm.project_tier_id !== undefined) {
    // Convert to string to ensure consistent type handling
    const projectTierId = String(localProjectForm.project_tier_id);
    dataToSubmit.append('project_tier_id', projectTierId);
    console.log('Added project_tier_id:', projectTierId, 'type:', typeof projectTierId);
} else {
    console.log('project_tier_id is null or undefined:', localProjectForm.project_tier_id);
}
```

### 2. Added Debugging Tools
- Added a watch on `project_tier_id` to log changes
- Added detailed FormData logging to verify contents before submission
- Added UI display of the current `project_tier_id` value and type
- Added change event handler to log when the dropdown value changes

### 3. Created Test Script
Created a test script with detailed instructions for verifying the fix:
- Steps to reproduce and test
- What to look for in console logs
- How to verify the payload in network requests
- Troubleshooting suggestions

## How to Verify
1. Open a project edit page
2. Select a project tier from the dropdown
3. Click "Update Basic Information"
4. Check the browser console for log messages confirming `project_tier_id` is included
5. Check the network request payload to verify `project_tier_id` is sent to the server

## Root Cause
The issue was likely due to one of the following:
1. Type conversion issues between the SelectDropdown component and FormData
2. The way FormData was being constructed, potentially excluding `project_tier_id`
3. Conditional logic that might have been filtering out `project_tier_id`

The fix ensures that `project_tier_id` is explicitly included in the FormData with proper type handling, regardless of any other conditions.
