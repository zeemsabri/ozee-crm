# Task Assignment Notification Feature

## Overview
This feature adds a notification system that sends an email and database notification to users when they are assigned a new task. The notification includes details about the task such as name, description, due date, and milestone.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Notification Class
Created a new Laravel notification class `TaskAssigned` that:
- Implements the `ShouldQueue` interface for background processing
- Sends notifications via email and database channels
- Includes task details in the notification

File: `/app/Notifications/TaskAssigned.php`

### 2. Updated Task Model
Modified the Task model's `booted` method to send a notification to the assigned user when a task is created with an assigned user.

Changes made to: `/app/Models/Task.php`

```php
// Send notification to assigned user if task is assigned
if ($task->assigned_to_user_id) {
    $task->load('assignedTo');
    if ($task->assignedTo) {
        try {
            $task->assignedTo->notify(new TaskAssigned($task));
            Log::info('Task assignment notification sent to user', [
                'task_id' => $task->id,
                'user_id' => $task->assigned_to_user_id
            ]);
        } catch (\Exception $notifyException) {
            Log::error('Failed to send task assignment notification: ' . $notifyException->getMessage(), [
                'task_id' => $task->id,
                'user_id' => $task->assigned_to_user_id,
                'exception' => $notifyException
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Created Notifications Table
Added a database migration to create the `notifications` table for storing database notifications.

File: `/database/migrations/2025_08_02_115520_create_notifications_table.php`

## Notification Content

### Email Notification
The email notification includes:
- Subject: "New Task Assigned: [Task Name]"
- Greeting with the user's name
- Task name
- Task description (if available)
- Due date (if available)
- Milestone name (if available)
- A button to view the task

### Database Notification
The database notification stores:
- Task ID
- Task name
- Description
- Due date
- Milestone ID and name
- Project ID and name

## Testing
A test script was created to verify the notification functionality:
- Verifies that notifications are sent to the assigned user
- Tests both faked notifications (for assertions) and real notifications

File: `/test-task-assignment-notification.php`

## Future Improvements
Potential future improvements to consider:
1. Add more notification channels (Slack, SMS, etc.)
2. Allow users to customize their notification preferences
3. Add notification for task updates (not just creation)
4. Include more task details in the notification
