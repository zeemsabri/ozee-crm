console.log('Testing read_at column implementation');

console.log('1. Verify that the API endpoints return the read_at column:');
console.log('- Check that /api/inbox/new-emails includes read_at in the response');
console.log('- Check that /api/inbox/all-emails includes read_at in the response');
console.log('- Check that /api/inbox/waiting-approval includes read_at in the response');

console.log('2. Verify that the EmailList component displays the read_at column:');
console.log('- Verify that the table header includes "Read At"');
console.log('- Verify that each row displays the formatted read_at timestamp or "Not read"');
console.log('- Verify that the timestamp is formatted as "MMM D, YYYY h:mm A" (e.g., "Aug 10, 2025 11:35 AM")');

console.log('3. Test marking an email as read:');
console.log('- Open an unread email');
console.log('- Verify that the API call to /api/inbox/emails/{id}/mark-as-read is made');
console.log('- Close the email and verify that the read_at column now shows a timestamp');

console.log('4. Test filtering and pagination:');
console.log('- Verify that the read_at column persists when applying filters');
console.log('- Verify that the read_at column persists when navigating between pages');

console.log('Test completed.');
