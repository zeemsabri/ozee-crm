# Notification System Fix

## Issue
The application was encountering an error in the browser console:
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: notificationContainer.addNotification is not a function
    at notify (notification.js:31:34)
```

This error occurred because the notification system was trying to call the `addNotification` method on a DOM element instead of the Vue component instance.

## Solution
The solution involved updating the `app.js` file to properly pass the Vue component instance to the notification utility.

### Changes Made

1. Updated `/resources/js/app.js` to:
   - Get the mounted NotificationContainer component instance using `notificationAppInstance._instance.component.exposed`
   - Pass this instance to `setNotificationContainer` instead of the DOM element

```javascript
// Before:
setNotificationContainer(notificationMountPoint);

// After:
const notificationInstance = notificationAppInstance._instance.component.exposed;
setNotificationContainer(notificationInstance);
```

## Testing
A test script was created to verify the notification system functionality:
- `/test-notification-system.js`

This script can be run in the browser console to check if notifications can be created successfully.

## Real-time Notifications
With this fix, the application can now properly display real-time notifications:

1. Task assignment notifications will be displayed in real-time to users when they are assigned a new task.
2. The notification will appear immediately without requiring a page refresh.

## Requirements
For this feature to work properly:

1. The Reverb server must be running:
   ```
   php artisan reverb:start
   ```

2. Laravel Echo must be properly initialized in `bootstrap.js` (fixed in previous update).

3. The user must be logged in to receive real-time notifications.
