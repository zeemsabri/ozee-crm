# Router-Level Permission Checks Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of router-level permission checks in the Email Approval App. The goal was to prevent unauthorized users from accessing pages they don't have permission for directly through the URL, rather than just hiding UI elements or redirecting after the page has loaded.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Existing Permission Middleware

The application already had a `CheckPermission` middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckPermission.php`) that was registered with the alias 'permission' in the Kernel.php file. This middleware:

- Checks if the user has the required permission
- Handles both global and project-specific permissions
- Throws a `PermissionDeniedException` if the user doesn't have the required permission

### 2. Routes Updated with Permission Middleware

We added the permission middleware to all routes that require specific permissions:

#### Project Routes
```php
// Projects Index Page
Route::get('/projects', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Projects/Index');
})->name('projects.index')->middleware('permission:view_projects');

// Projects Create Page
Route::get('/projects/create', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Projects/Create');
})->name('projects.create')->middleware('permission:create_projects');

// Projects Edit Page
Route::get('/projects/{project}/edit', function (Project $project) {
    return Inertia::render('Projects/Edit', [
        'project' => $project,
    ]);
})->name('projects.edit')->middleware('permission:create_projects');

// Project Detail Page
Route::get('/projects/{id}', function ($id) {
    return Inertia::render('Projects/Show', [
        'id' => $id,
    ]);
})->name('projects.show')->middleware('permission:view_projects');
```

#### Email Routes
```php
// Email Composer Page
Route::get('/emails/compose', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Emails/Composer');
})->name('emails.compose')->middleware('permission:compose_emails');

// Pending Approvals Page
Route::get('/emails/pending', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Emails/PendingApprovals');
})->name('emails.pending')->middleware('permission:approve_emails');

Route::get('/emails/rejected', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Emails/Rejected');
})->name('emails.rejected')->middleware('permission:compose_emails');
```

#### User Management Routes
```php
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index');
})->name('users.index')->middleware('permission:create_users');

// Availability Calendar Page
Route::get('/availability', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Availability/Index');
})->name('availability.index')->middleware('permission:create_users');
```

#### Other Routes
```php
// Bonus Configuration Page
Route::get('/bonus-configuration', function () {
    return Inertia::render('BonusConfiguration/Index');
})->name('bonus-configuration.index')->middleware('permission:manage_bonus_configuration');

Route::get('/shareable-resources', function () {
    return Inertia::render('ShareableResources/Index');
})->name('shareable-resources.index')->middleware('permission:view_shareable_resources');
```

### 3. Component Updates

We removed redundant client-side permission checks from components since the router-level middleware now handles access control:

- Removed the `onMounted` hook in `Create.vue` that redirected users without the `create_projects` permission
- Removed the `onMounted` hook in `Edit.vue` that performed a similar check

### 4. Testing

We created a test script (`test-router-permissions.php`) to verify that:

1. Users without the required permissions don't have access to protected routes
2. Users with the required permissions do have access
3. The routes have the correct middleware applied

## Benefits

1. **Security Improvement**: Unauthorized users can't access restricted pages even if they know the direct URL
2. **Consistent Access Control**: Permission checks are applied at the router level, ensuring consistent enforcement
3. **Simplified Components**: Frontend components don't need to handle permission-based redirects
4. **Better User Experience**: Users are immediately redirected if they don't have permission, rather than seeing a page load and then being redirected

## Conclusion

By implementing router-level permission checks, we've improved the security and user experience of the application. Unauthorized users are now prevented from accessing pages they don't have permission for at the router level, rather than after the page has loaded.
