# Rejected Email Body Editor Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a rich text editor for the email body in the Rejected Emails modal, making it consistent with the Composer.vue component. This change ensures that formatting is preserved when editing a rejected email.

## Issue Description

The issue was that the email body in the rejected modal was not the same as in the Composer.vue component. Specifically:

- Composer.vue used a RichTextEditor component for the email body, which provides rich text formatting capabilities
- Rejected.vue used a simple textarea for the email body, which doesn't support formatting

This inconsistency meant that any formatting in the email body was lost when editing a rejected email, and users couldn't add formatting when editing a rejected email.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

#### 1. Imported the RichTextEditor Component

Added the import statement for the RichTextEditor component in Rejected.vue:

```javascript
import RichTextEditor from '@/Components/RichTextEditor.vue';
```

#### 2. Replaced the Textarea with the RichTextEditor Component

Replaced the textarea element with the RichTextEditor component in the template:

**Before:**
```html
<div class="mb-6">
    <InputLabel for="body" value="Email Body" />
    <textarea id="body" rows="10" class="border-gray-300 focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500 rounded-md shadow-sm mt-1 block w-full" v-model="editForm.body" required></textarea>
    <InputError :message="editErrors.body ? editErrors.body[0] : ''" class="mt-2" />
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="mb-6">
    <InputLabel for="body" value="Email Body" />
    <RichTextEditor
        id="body"
        v-model="editForm.body"
        placeholder="Edit your email here..."
        height="300px"
    />
    <InputError :message="editErrors.body ? editErrors.body[0] : ''" class="mt-2" />
</div>
```

### How It Works

1. The RichTextEditor component provides a toolbar with formatting options (bold, italic, underline, lists, links)
2. It uses the contenteditable attribute and document.execCommand for formatting
3. It emits an 'update:modelValue' event when the content changes, which works with v-model
4. When a user edits a rejected email, any existing formatting is preserved, and they can add new formatting

## Testing

A test script (`test-rejected-email-body-editor.js`) was created to verify that the RichTextEditor works correctly in the Rejected.vue component. The script tests:

1. That the RichTextEditor and toolbar elements are present in the DOM
2. That formatting is preserved in the editor
3. That toolbar buttons are available for formatting
4. That the formatted content is saved correctly when submitting the form

To run the test script:

1. Navigate to the Rejected Emails page in the browser
2. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `test-rejected-email-body-editor.js` into the console
4. Press Enter to run the tests

## Impact

This change improves the user experience when editing rejected emails by:

1. Preserving formatting when editing a rejected email
2. Allowing users to add formatting when editing a rejected email
3. Making the email body editor consistent between Composer.vue and Rejected.vue
4. Ensuring that the formatted content is saved correctly when submitting the form
