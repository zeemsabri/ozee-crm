# All Emails Tab Filters Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of client, project, and sender filters in the All Emails tab of the Inbox page, as well as the addition of a sender column to the email list display.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (AllEmailsTab.vue)
1. Added new filter fields to the reactive filters object:
   - `client_id`
   - `project_id`
   - `sender_id`

2. Added code to fetch filter options (clients, projects, and senders) from the API.

3. Updated the fetchEmails function to include the new filter parameters in the API request.

4. Updated the resetFilters function to reset the new filter fields.

5. Added UI elements for the new filters:
   - Client dropdown
   - Project dropdown
   - Sender dropdown

6. Added onMounted hook to fetch filter options when the component is mounted.

### Backend (InboxController.php)
1. Added support for filtering emails by client:
   ```php
   if ($request->has('client_id') && !empty($request->client_id)) {
       $query->whereHas('conversation.project.clients', function ($query) use ($request) {
           $query->where('clients.id', $request->client_id);
       });
   }
   ```

2. Added support for filtering emails by project:
   ```php
   if ($request->has('project_id') && !empty($request->project_id)) {
       $query->whereHas('conversation', function ($query) use ($request) {
           $query->where('project_id', $request->project_id);
       });
   }
   ```

3. Added support for filtering emails by sender:
   ```php
   if ($request->has('sender_id') && !empty($request->sender_id)) {
       $query->where(function ($query) use ($request) {
           $query->where('sender_id', $request->sender_id)
                 ->where('sender_type', 'App\\Models\\User');
       });
   }
   ```

## Testing
A test script has been created to verify the functionality of the new filters. The script includes tests for:
1. Client filter
2. Project filter
3. Sender filter
4. Combined filters
5. Reset filters functionality

## Benefits
1. Users can now filter emails by client, project, and sender, making it easier to find specific emails.
2. The filters work with the existing pagination system, ensuring good performance even with large numbers of emails.
3. The UI is intuitive and consistent with the existing filter design.
