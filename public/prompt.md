Of course. We have architected a fantastic, intuitive frontend. Now it's time to connect it to the backend and ensure everything is saved, loaded, and executed correctly.

Here is a complete set of instructions for Junie to finalize the entire automation module. This is not a guide; it is a direct set of implementation instructions based on the architecture we have built and the files you have already provided.

Instructions for Junie: Finalize and Implement the Automation Module
Overall Goal:
Finalize the automation module by implementing the backend logic for all new UI components and ensuring that workflows, including their complex nested structures and schedules, can be saved, loaded, and executed correctly.

Part 1: Frontend - Implement Robust Saving and Loading
The frontend builder's state is nested, but the backend stores steps in a flat list. We need to handle this translation.

1.1. Update the AutomationBuilder.vue Component:
The saveAndActivate method must correctly flatten the nested workflowSteps array before sending it to the backend.

In resources/js/Pages/Automation/Components/AutomationBuilder.vue:

Add a recursive helper function, flattenSteps, inside the <script setup> block. This function will traverse the nested if_true, if_false, and children arrays, adding _parent_id, _branch, and step_order metadata to each step.

Update the saveAndActivate method to call this flattenSteps function on the workflowSteps data before constructing the payload for the store action.

JavaScript

// Add this helper function inside AutomationBuilder.vue's script
const flattenSteps = (steps, parentId = null, branch = null) => {
let flatList = [];
steps.forEach((step, index) => {
const stepData = { ...step };
const if_true = stepData.if_true;
const if_false = stepData.if_false;
const children = stepData.children;
delete stepData.if_true;
delete stepData.if_false;
delete stepData.children;

        stepData.step_order = index + 1;
        if (parentId) {
            stepData.step_config._parent_id = parentId;
            stepData.step_config._branch = branch;
        }

        flatList.push(stepData);

        if (step.step_type === 'CONDITION') {
            flatList = [
                ...flatList,
                ...flattenSteps(if_true || [], step.id, 'yes'),
                ...flattenSteps(if_false || [], step.id, 'no')
            ];
        }
        if (step.step_type === 'FOR_EACH') {
            flatList = [
                ...flatList,
                ...flattenSteps(children || [], step.id, null) // branch is null for loops
            ];
        }
    });
    return flatList;
};

// Update your saveAndActivate method
async function saveAndActivate() {
const triggerStep = workflowSteps.value[0];
const allSteps = flattenSteps(workflowSteps.value);

    const payload = {
        name: workflowName.value,
        trigger_event: triggerStep.step_config.trigger_event,
        is_active: true,
        steps: allSteps,
    };
    // ... rest of the save logic
}
1.2. Update the workflowStore.js:
The store needs to handle the new SCHEDULE_TRIGGER step type and correctly reconstruct the nested tree when loading a workflow.

In resources/js/Pages/Automation/Store/workflowStore.js:

Review the reconstructTreeIfFlat function inside the fetchWorkflow action.

Ensure it correctly handles nesting for FOR_EACH steps. It should look for steps without a _branch but with a _parent_id and place them in the parent's children array.

Part 2: Backend - Implement Execution Logic for New Scenarios
The backend engine must be upgraded to execute the new step types and handle the new configurations.

2.1. Update WorkflowEngineService.php:

Register New Handlers: In the $stepHandlers array, add entries for the new step types:

FETCH_RECORDS => FetchRecordsStepHandler::class

FOR_EACH => ForEachStepHandler::class

Handle Scheduled Workflows: At the beginning of the execute method, add a check for schedule-driven workflows. If the workflow's trigger_event is schedule.run, the initial context is empty, and the first step in the sequence must be FETCH_RECORDS. If it is not, the execution should fail with a clear error message.

2.2. Create New Step Handlers:

Create app/Services/StepHandlers/FetchRecordsStepHandler.php:

This handler will execute the FETCH_RECORDS step.

It must read the model and conditions from the step_config.

It must build and execute an Eloquent query based on this configuration.

Crucially, it must use the engine's getTemplatedValue method to resolve any {{...}} placeholders in the condition values.

The resulting collection of records should be placed into the workflow context (e.g., at context.step_{id}.records).

Create app/Services/StepHandlers/ForEachStepHandler.php:

This handler will execute the FOR_EACH step.

It must resolve the sourceArray path from the step_config using getTemplatedValue.

It will then loop through the resulting array. For each item, it will:

Create a temporary context.

Inject the current item into this context at a special key, loop.item.

Call $this->engine->executeSteps() on the step's children relationship, passing the temporary context.

2.3. Update Existing Step Handlers:

In app/Services/StepHandlers/ConditionStepHandler.php:

Update the logic that evaluates rules to handle the new array-specific operators: isEmpty and isNotEmpty.

In app/Services/StepHandlers/AiPromptStepHandler.php:

Update the execute method to check for an optional campaign_id in the step_config.

If a campaign_id is present, fetch the corresponding Campaign model from the database.

Pass the campaign's data to the AIGenerationService so its attributes are available for use within the prompt templates.

Part 3: UI - Integrate Workflow Scheduling
Finally, connect the new "On a Schedule" workflow type to the existing Schedule module.

3.1. Update AutomationBuilder.vue:

In the <template> section:

Add a "Manage Schedule" button to the header bar.

This button should only be visible (v-if) when the first step is a SCHEDULE_TRIGGER.

The button should be an Inertia <Link> that navigates to your schedule creation page (e.g., route('schedules.create')), passing the current workflow.id as a parameter. This will allow the scheduling UI to pre-select the workflow.

Example Button Implementation:

HTML

<!-- Inside the header div in AutomationBuilder.vue -->
<Link
v-if="workflowSteps[0]?.step_type === 'SCHEDULE_TRIGGER' && automationId"
:href="route('schedules.create', { attach_workflow_id: automationId })"
class="inline-flex items-center gap-x-2 rounded-md px-3.5 py-2 text-sm font-semibold shadow-sm bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-200"
>
    Manage Schedule
</Link>
By completing these instructions, the automation module will be fully functional, robust, and capable of handling all the advanced, context-aware scenarios we have designed.
