# User Pivot Role Display Fix

## Issue Description

In the Projects/Show.vue file at line 393, the user's role in the project was not being displayed correctly:

```html
<p><strong class="text-gray-900">{{ user.name }}</strong> ({{ user.pivot.role }})</p>
```

The issue was that `user.pivot.role` was blank, even though we had previously implemented fixes to load role information into `user.pivot.role_data`.

## Root Cause

The root cause of the issue was that in the ProjectController's show method, we were loading the role information and setting it in `user.pivot.role_data`, but we weren't setting `user.pivot.role` directly. The template was trying to display `user.pivot.role`, but this property was not being set.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the ProjectController.php file to set `user.pivot.role` to the role name after setting `user.pivot.role_data`:

```php
// Add the project role information to the pivot data with permissions included
// This avoids indirect modification of the overloaded property
$user->pivot->role_data = [
    'id' => $projectRole->id,
    'name' => $projectRole->name,
    'slug' => $projectRole->slug,
    'permissions' => $permissions
];

// Also set the role property directly for display in the UI
$user->pivot->role = $projectRole->name;
```

This change ensures that when the project data is returned to the frontend, each user in the project will have their role name set in the `user.pivot.role` property, which is what's being displayed in the Show.vue template.

## Implementation Details

The change was made in the ProjectController.php file, in the show method, where we load the role information for each user's project-specific role. After setting the role_data property, we added a line to set the role property directly:

```php
// Also set the role property directly for display in the UI
$user->pivot->role = $projectRole->name;
```

This ensures that the role name is available for display in the UI.

## Verification

To verify that the changes work correctly, you can:

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to a project where users have project-specific roles
3. Check if the role name is displayed correctly next to each user's name in the "Assigned Team" section

Alternatively, you can run the test script we created:

```bash
php test-user-pivot-role-display.php
```

This script will:
1. Find a test project with users
2. Identify a user with a project-specific role
3. Get the role information for that project-specific role
4. Call the ProjectController's show method directly
5. Check if the response contains the user.pivot.role property
6. Verify that the role property matches the expected role name

## Impact on Other Parts of the Application

The changes made are isolated to the ProjectController's show method and only affect how role information is returned to the frontend. They do not affect how permissions are checked or how roles are stored in the database.

## Future Considerations

If similar issues arise in the future where data is not being displayed correctly in the UI, consider:

1. Checking if the property being referenced in the template exists in the data returned from the API
2. Ensuring that all necessary properties are set in the controller before returning the response
3. Using Vue.js developer tools to inspect the data being received by the component

By following these steps, you can quickly identify and fix similar issues in the future.
