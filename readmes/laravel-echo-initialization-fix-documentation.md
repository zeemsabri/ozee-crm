# Laravel Echo Initialization Fix

## Issue
The application was encountering an error in the browser console:
```
app.js:93 Laravel Echo is not initialized. Check your bootstrap.js file.
```

This error occurred because Laravel Echo was not properly initialized in the `bootstrap.js` file, preventing real-time notifications from working.

## Solution
The solution involved updating the `bootstrap.js` file to properly initialize Laravel Echo with Reverb configuration.

### Changes Made

1. Updated `/resources/js/bootstrap.js` to:
   - Import Laravel Echo and Pusher.js
   - Initialize window.Echo with the correct Reverb configuration
   - Use environment variables from Vite for configuration values

```javascript
// Added imports
import Echo from 'laravel-echo';
import Pusher from 'pusher-js';

// Added Echo initialization
window.Pusher = Pusher;
window.Echo = new Echo({
    broadcaster: 'reverb',
    key: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY,
    wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_HOST,
    wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT,
    wssPort: import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_PORT,
    forceTLS: (import.meta.env.VITE_REVERB_SCHEME === 'https'),
    enabledTransports: ['ws', 'wss'],
    disableStats: true,
});
```

## Testing
A test script was created to verify the Laravel Echo initialization:
- `/test-echo-initialization.js`

This script can be run in the browser console to check if Laravel Echo is properly initialized and configured.

## Real-time Notifications
With this fix, the application can now receive real-time notifications:

1. Task assignment notifications will be delivered in real-time to users when they are assigned a new task.
2. The notification will appear immediately without requiring a page refresh.

## Requirements
For this feature to work properly:

1. The Reverb server must be running:
   ```
   php artisan reverb:start
   ```

2. The following environment variables must be set in `.env`:
   ```
   REVERB_APP_ID=303349
   REVERB_APP_KEY=mmov0fjqpewbygrzsbds
   REVERB_APP_SECRET=wvetypxv1yjwculcsrg2
   REVERB_HOST="localhost"
   REVERB_PORT=8080
   REVERB_SCHEME=http
   
   VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY="${REVERB_APP_KEY}"
   VITE_REVERB_HOST="${REVERB_HOST}"
   VITE_REVERB_PORT="${REVERB_PORT}"
   VITE_REVERB_SCHEME="${REVERB_SCHEME}"
   ```

3. The broadcast driver must be set to Reverb:
   ```
   BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb
   ```
